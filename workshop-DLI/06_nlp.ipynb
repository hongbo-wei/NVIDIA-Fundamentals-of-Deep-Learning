For our example, we'll use text sentences. Language is naturally composed of sequence data, in the form of characters in words, and words in sentences. Other examples of sequence data include stock prices and  weather data over time. Videos, while containing still images, are also sequences. Elements in the data have a relationship with what comes before and what comes after, and this fact requires a different approach."
