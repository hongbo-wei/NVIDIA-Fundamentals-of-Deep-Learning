But what if we cannot find a pre-trained model that does exactly what you need, and what if we do not have a sufficiently large dataset to train a model from scratch? In this case, there is a very helpful technique we can use called [transfer learning](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/02/07/what-is-transfer-learning/).\n",

A good analogy for this is an artist who is skilled in one medium, such as painting, who wants to learn to practice in another medium, such as charcoal drawing. We can imagine that the skills they learned while painting would be very valuable in learning how to draw with charcoal. \n",
